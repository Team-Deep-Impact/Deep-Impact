# Physics and Math in the Asteroid Collision Simulation

## Overview

This simulation models the interaction between an asteroid, Earth, and a deflection rocket. It uses fundamental principles of physics and mathematics to simulate gravitational forces, velocity and position updates, and the application of velocity impulses for deflection. Here, we explain the key equations and their relevance.

## Gravitational Force

### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

The gravitational force \( F \) between Earth and the asteroid is given by:

$$
F = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{d^2}
$$

Where:
- \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\(1 \times 10^{-8}\) for this simulation).
- \( m_1 \) is the mass of Earth.
- \( m_2 \) is the mass of the asteroid.
- \( d \) is the distance between the centers of Earth and the asteroid.

This force determines the gravitational pull exerted by Earth on the asteroid, influencing its trajectory as it approaches Earth.

### Acceleration

Using Newton's second law of motion, the acceleration \( a \) of the asteroid due to Earth's gravitational force is calculated as:

$$
a = \frac{F}{m_2}
$$

Where:
- \( F \) is the gravitational force.
- \( m_2 \) is the mass of the asteroid.

The acceleration components in the x and y directions are:

$$
a_x = a \cdot \frac{dx}{d}
$$

$$
a_y = a \cdot \frac{dy}{d}
$$

Where:
- \( dx \) and \( dy \) are the differences in the x and y coordinates between Earth and the asteroid.
- \( d \) is the distance between Earth and the asteroid.

## Velocity and Position Updates

The asteroid's velocity is updated using the calculated acceleration:

$$
v_x = v_x + a_x \cdot \Delta t
$$

$$
v_y = v_y + a_y \cdot \Delta t
$$

Where:
- \( v_x \) and \( v_y \) are the velocity components of the asteroid.
- \( a_x \) and \( a_y \) are the acceleration components.
- \( \Delta t \) is the time step of the simulation.

The new position of the asteroid is calculated as:

$$
x = x + v_x \cdot \Delta t
$$

$$
y = y + v_y \cdot \Delta t
$$

Where:
- \( x \) and \( y \) are the position coordinates of the asteroid.

## Deflection Strategy and Velocity Impulse

When the deflection rocket collides with the asteroid, a velocity impulse is applied to alter its trajectory. The impulse depends on the selected deflection strategy and the angle of impact.

### Impulse Calculation

The impulse components are calculated as:

$$
\text{impulse}_x = I \cdot \cos(\theta)
$$

$$
\text{impulse}_y = I \cdot \sin(\theta)
$$

Where:
- \( I \) is the magnitude of the impulse, determined by the deflection strategy.
- \( \theta \) is the angle of impact between the rocket and the asteroid.

The new velocity of the asteroid after the impulse is:

$$
v_x = v_x + \text{impulse}_x
$$

$$
v_y = v_y + \text{impulse}_y
$$

By updating the velocity and position of the asteroid at each time step, the simulation provides a realistic representation of its motion and interaction with Earth and the deflection rocket.
