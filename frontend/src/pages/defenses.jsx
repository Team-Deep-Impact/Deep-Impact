          <h2 className="text-center underline text-xl text-white my-5">What Can We Do?</h2>
          <p className="text-l text-white">Defending Earth against potentially hazardous meteors or asteroids involves several strategies and technologies, primarily focused on detection, deflection, and disruption. Here are the primary defense options:</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl text-white my-5">Early Detection and Monitoring</h3>
          <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Space-Based Telescopes:</strong> Deploying telescopes in space to continuously monitor the sky for Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). Examples include NASA’s NEOWISE mission and the upcoming NEOCam.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Ground-Based Telescopes:</strong> Utilizing a network of observatories around the world to detect and track asteroids. Projects like the Pan-STARRS and the Catalina Sky Survey are part of this effort.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Data Sharing and Coordination:</strong> International collaboration through organizations like the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG) to share data and coordinate responses.
        </li>
      </ul>
          <h3 class="text-xl text-white my-5">Deflection Techniques</h3>
          <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Kinetic Impactor:</strong> This involves sending a spacecraft to collide with the asteroid at high speed, changing its trajectory. NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is an example, scheduled to test this method on the moonlet of the asteroid Didymos.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Gravity Tractor:</strong> A spacecraft would fly alongside the asteroid for an extended period, using its gravitational pull to gradually alter the asteroid’s path.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Ion Beam Shepherd:</strong> This concept involves using ion thrusters to create a continuous stream of particles that push against the asteroid, slowly changing its trajectory over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl text-white my-5">Disruption Techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Nuclear Explosions:</strong> A nuclear device could be detonated near or on the asteroid to either vaporize a portion of it or to alter its course significantly. This is considered a last resort due to the potential for fragmenting the asteroid into multiple pieces, which might still pose a threat.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Laser Ablation:</strong> Using high-powered lasers to vaporize the surface of the asteroid, creating jets of gas that would act as a propulsion mechanism to nudge the asteroid off course.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl text-white my-5">Civil Protection and Mitigation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Impact Prediction and Modeling:</strong> Improved computer models to predict impact locations, potential damage, and secondary effects like tsunamis and atmospheric changes.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Evacuation Plans:</strong> Developing and rehearsing evacuation plans for regions identified as potential impact sites.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Global Response Coordination:</strong> Establishing international protocols for disaster response, resource distribution, and public communication.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl text-white my-5">General Effects on Human Civilization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Economic Disruption:</strong> Severe damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and resources can lead to economic collapse in affected regions.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Human Casualties:</strong> Direct impact areas would suffer heavy casualties, with potential global consequences from secondary effects like famine and disease.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Global Cooperation and Response:</strong> Such an event would likely necessitate global cooperation for disaster response, food distribution, and potentially relocation of populations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl text-white my-5">International Collaboration and Policy Development</h3>
      <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Space Treaties and Agreements:</strong> Strengthening international treaties and agreements to ensure cooperation and shared responsibility in asteroid detection and deflection efforts.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Funding and Research:</strong> Increasing funding for asteroid research, detection programs, and the development of deflection technologies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl text-white my-5">Key Missions and Programs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO):</strong>  Coordinates efforts to detect, track, and characterize potentially hazardous asteroids and comets.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>ESA’s Hera Mission:</strong> A follow-up to NASA’s DART mission, Hera will study the aftermath of the DART impact to gather critical data on the effectiveness of kinetic impactors.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Program:</strong> Run by the European Space Agency (ESA) to detect and track objects that pose a risk to Earth or to satellites in orbit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl text-white my-5">Challenges and Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Timely Detection:</strong> Early detection is crucial, as deflection methods are more effective when applied well in advance of a potential impact.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>Technological Development:</strong> Many of the proposed deflection techniques are still in the research or testing phase and require further development.
        </li>
        <li className="text-l text-white mb-3">
          <strong>International Cooperation:</strong> Effective planetary defense requires global collaboration, as the impact of a large asteroid would have worldwide consequences.
        </li>
      </ul>
