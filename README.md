## Features

1. **Asteroid Visualization**: Visualize incoming asteroids using real-time data from the NASA NeoWs API.
2. **Scenario & Deflection Strategies**: Explore various methods of asteroid deflection, such as Nuclear Detonation, Kinetic Impact, and Gravity Tractor.
3. **Simulation Tool**: Simulate asteroid trajectories and deflection outcomes.
4. **Dashboard**: View the dashboard, and other pages with relevant information and insights.

## Getting Started

### Django Backend Setup

1. **Set Up Python Environment**:
    - Vanilla Python:
        ```sh
        python -m venv deep-impact-env
        ```
    - Virtual Environment Wrapper:
        ```sh
        mkvirtualenv deep-impact-env
        ```
    - Activate the environment:
        ```sh
        source deep-impact-env/bin/activate
        ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
    - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
        ```sh
        cd Deep-Impact/backend/deep_impact_proj
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

### Vite Frontend Setup

1. **Install Node Modules**:
    - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```

2. **Run Development Server**:
    - Start the development server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
